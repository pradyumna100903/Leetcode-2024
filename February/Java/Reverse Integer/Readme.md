## Initialization:
- `finalNum` is initialized to 0 to store the reversed integer.

## While Loop:
- The code enters a while loop that continues until `x` becomes 0.
- Inside the loop, the last digit of `x` is obtained using `x % 10`.
- The last digit is added to `finalNum`, and `finalNum` is multiplied by 10 to prepare for the next digit.
- The last digit is removed from `x` by performing integer division (`x / 10`).

## Adjustment:
- After the loop, `finalNum` is divided by 10 to compensate for the extra multiplication within the loop.

## Overflow Check:
- If `finalNum` exceeds the limits of an integer (`Integer.MAX_VALUE` or `Integer.MIN_VALUE`), the function returns 0 to avoid overflow.

## Negative Number Handling:
- If the input `x` was negative, the result is negated before returning.

## Final Result:
- The final reversed integer, converted to an integer type, is returned.
