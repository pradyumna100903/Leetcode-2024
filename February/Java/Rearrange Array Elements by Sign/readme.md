**Class Name:**

* `Solution`: This class provides a method to rearrange array elements.

**Method:**

* **`public int[] rearrangeArray(int[] nums)`:**
    * Takes an integer array (`nums`) as input.
    * Returns a rearranged array with positive and negative numbers interleaved.

**Logic:**

1. **Initialization:**
    * `int positiveIndex = 0`: Points to where positive numbers are placed.
    * `int negativeIndex = 1`: Points to where negative numbers are placed (odd indices).
    * `int newArray[] = new int[nums.length]`: Holds the rearranged elements.

2. **Rearrangement Loop:**
    * Iterates through each element in `nums`:
        * If the element is negative:
            * Place it at `negativeIndex` in `newArray`.
            * Increment `negativeIndex` by 2 (move to the next odd position).
        * If the element is positive:
            * Place it at `positiveIndex` in `newArray`.
            * Increment `positiveIndex` by 2 (move to the next even position).

3. **Return Rearranged Array:**
    * Returns the `newArray` with interleaved elements.

**Key Points:**

* **Interleaving:** Arranges positive and negative numbers in an alternating pattern.
* **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.
* **Space Complexity:** O(n), using an additional array of the same size as the input.
* **Assumption:** The code assumes an equal number of positive and negative elements in the input array.
