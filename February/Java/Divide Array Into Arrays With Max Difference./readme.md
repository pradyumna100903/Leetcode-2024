## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` of size n and a positive integer k.

Divide the array into one or more arrays of size 3 satisfying the following conditions:

- Each element of `nums` should be in exactly one array.
- The difference between any two elements in one array is less than or equal to k.

Return a 2D array containing all the arrays. If it is impossible to satisfy the conditions, return an empty array. And if there are multiple answers, return any of them.

### Example 1:

+ Input: nums = [1, 3, 4, 8, 7, 9, 3, 5, 1], k = 2
+ Output: [[1, 1, 3], [3, 4, 5], [7, 8, 9]]
+ Explanation: We can divide the array into the following arrays: [1, 1, 3], [3, 4, 5], and [7, 8, 9].
+ The difference between any two elements in each array is less than or equal to 2.
+ Note that the order of elements is not important.

### Example 2: 
+ Input: nums = [1, 3, 3, 2, 7, 3], k = 3
+ Output: []
+ Explanation: It is not possible to divide the array satisfying all the conditions.

## Constraints

- n == `nums.length`
- 1 <= n <= 105
- n is a multiple of 3.
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 105
- 1 <= k <= 105


## Approach Explanation

To split a given 1D array into a 2D array with subarrays of size 3 and a maximum difference of `k`, the following approach can be used:

1. **Sorting:** As the given array is unsorted, sorting it provides the best chance of creating subarrays with the maximum possibility. This can be achieved using any sorting technique.

2. **Iterating through Sorted Array:**
   - Iterate through the sorted array using two indices `i` and `j`. Increment `i` by `3` and `j` by `1` in each iteration.
   - Additionally, use one more variable `m` for iterating through the result array.

3. **Creating Subarrays:**
   - Initialize the first element of the subarray directly: `res[m][0] = nums[i]`.
   - For the second and third elements in the subarray, compare them with `res[m][0]` to ensure that the difference is less than or equal to `k`.

This approach ensures that the given array is sorted and then split into groups of 3 with a maximum difference of `k`.
