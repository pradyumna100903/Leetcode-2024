## Intuition
Keeping track of frequency of characters in a fixed sized array as only alphabets and digits are present string.All will be used is constant spaces and constant loops.

## Approach
Keeping the frequency count of each characters in a fixed sized array.Using fixed sized loops to check for maximum frequency of characters and putting 0 in place of maximum frequency alphabet and converting it into index into alphabets and storing in the string variable.

## Complexity
### Time complexity: O(n)O(n)O(n)

### Space complexity: O(1)O(1)O(1)
