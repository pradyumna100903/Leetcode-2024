## Dynamic Programming Approach :
Idea behind this
In this question we try a technique which is called partition . 
In which we traverse the string from the starting point and try make all possible partion which can be made using recursion , at last find out the maximum sum calculate.

## Complexity
Time complexity: O(n∗k)O(n*k)O(n∗k) <br> 
Space complexity: O(k)O(k)O(k)
