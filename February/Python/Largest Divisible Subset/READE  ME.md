# Largest Divisible Subset

The given Python code defines a class named `Solution` with a method `largestDivisibleSubset`. This method takes a list of integers `nums` as input and aims to find the largest divisible subset of these numbers.

## Algorithm

1. **Base Case Check:** If the input list `nums` is empty, the method returns an empty list since there is no subset to consider.

2. **Sort the Input:** The input list `nums` is sorted in ascending order.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:** The method initializes a list `result`, where each element represents a subset ending at the corresponding index in the sorted `nums` list. Initially, each subset contains only one element from the sorted list.

4. **Subset Construction:** Using nested loops, the method iterates through the elements of `nums`. For each element at index `i`, it checks all previous elements (index `j`) to determine if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. If the condition is met and the length of the subset ending at `i` is less than the length of the subset ending at `j + 1`, the subset ending at `i` is updated to include the current element.

5. **Result Extraction:** The method returns the largest subset in terms of length using the `max` function with the `key=len`. This ensures that the result is the subset with the maximum length found during the dynamic programming process.

## Usage

```python
# Example Usage
solution = Solution()
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 16]
result = solution.largestDivisibleSubset(nums)
print(result)
