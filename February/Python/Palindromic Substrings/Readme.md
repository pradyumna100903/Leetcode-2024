# Palindromic Substrings Count

The given Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `countSubstrings` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the count of palindromic substrings in the given string.

## Approach:

The code uses a straightforward approach to count palindromic substrings. It iterates through each character in the string `s` and treats it as the center of a potential palindrome. Two loops are used to check for palindromes with odd and even lengths.

1. **Odd-Length Palindromes:**
   - Initialize two pointers `l` and `r` to the current index `i`.
   - Expand the pointers outward (towards the beginning and end of the string) while the characters at positions `l` and `r` are equal.
   - Increment the result count for each valid palindrome found.

2. **Even-Length Palindromes:**
   - Initialize `l` to the current index `i` and `r` to `i + 1`.
   - Similar to the odd-length case, expand the pointers outward and increment the result count for each valid palindrome.

## Result:
The total count of palindromic substrings is accumulated in the variable `res`, which is then returned as the final result.

The code utilizes the fact that a palindrome can be expanded from its center, checking both odd and even lengths, resulting in an efficient solution for counting palindromic substrings in the given string.
