# Majority Element

The given Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `majorityElement` that takes a list of integers `nums` as input and returns the majority element in the list. The majority element is defined as the element that appears more than ⌊n/2⌋ times, where n is the length of the array.

## Approach:

The code uses a variant of the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm to find the majority element efficiently in a single pass through the array.

1. Initialize variables `res` and `count` to 0.
2. Iterate through each element `n` in the input array `nums`.
   - If `count` becomes 0, update `res` to the current element `n`.
   - Increment or decrement `count` based on whether the current element is equal to the current majority candidate.
3. The final value of `res` will be the majority element.

## Result:
The code efficiently identifies the majority element in the given array using constant space and linear time complexity. This algorithm works under the assumption that there is always a majority element in the array (i.e., an element that appears more than half of the array's length).
